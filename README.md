## What is HoneyWhere?
Have you ever asked your "honey" where something is and neither one of you can seem to remember where the heck it ended up? You check everywhere and you call it quits, only to buy it again and find the original thing MONTHS later. Buying two of the same thing because you misplaced it? In this economy?!

Enter HoneyWhere! üçØ 

HoneyWhere started off as an idea born out of the frustrations of never being able to find that *one thing* you don't use that often in your home. The application's premise is simple - be able to add your items from places in your home, then be able to easily search and find them without the pains of both you and your honey taking WAY too much time to find something.
